While some patterns may be benign, such as service account activity, the presence of unknown authentication types and NTLM usage in a Kerberos environment warrants further investigation.",

Review the access patterns of machine accounts like C20$@DOM1 to ensure they align with expected behavior. Consider implementing stricter monitoring and logging for these accounts."
