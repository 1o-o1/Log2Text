    "recommended_actions": "Investigate the ANONYMOUS LOGON event on C2719 immediately, review the sequence of authentication events for potential lateral movement, and ensure that machine accounts have appropriate permissions. Consider implementing stricter monitoring and alerting for ANONYMOUS LOGON and unspecified authentication types."
